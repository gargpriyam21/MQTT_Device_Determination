This repository is created for the sole purpose of uploading codes related to the Assignment 3 for the course CSC 591 - 022 Internet of Things: Architectures, Applications, and Implementation Spring 2022 of North Carolina State University.

## Environment
- macOS Monterey Version 12.2.1
- Python 3.7.3

**VISHAL TO EXPLAIN THE HARDWARE ENVIRONMENT FOR RASPBERRY PI B**

## Requirements
### Software
- Python3 3.7.3
- paho-mqtt
- mosquitto

### Hardware
**VISHAL TO EXPLAIN THE HARDWARE PART FOR RASPBERRY PI B**

## Procedure
Initially update the `BROKER_IP_ADDRESS` in the code file (*RPiB.py*) to the IP_ADDRESS of device where the Broker is currently running. If the broker is on the same device update the value to **'localhost'**
Run the ***Raspberry Pi B (this will only be subscriber)*** code by executing the below command on the Raspberry Pi
