# IoT_ASN3_G11 - MQTT publisher as well as subscriber (Raspberry Pi A)

This repository is created for the sole purpose of uploading codes related to the Assignment 3 for the course CSC 591 - 022 Internet of Things: Architectures, Applications, and Implementation Spring 2022 of North Carolina State University.

## Environment
- Python 3.7.3

**JORDAN TO UPDATE THE SOFTWARE ENVIRONMENT FOR RASPBERRY PI B**

## Requirements
### Software
- Python3 3.7.3
- paho-mqtt 1.6.1
- mosquitto
**JORDAN TO UPDATE THE SOFTWARE PROCEDURE FOR RASPBERRY PI B**

### Hardware
- Raspberry Pi 3B
- 1 photoresistor
- 1 500 kOhm Potentiometer
- 1 220 nF capacitor
- 1 1 uF capacitor
- 2 1 kOhm resistors


For our implementation, we didnâ€™t use an ADC. Instead we measured the time it took for capacitors to either charge or discharge by monitoring how long it takes for the raspberry pi input pins to change from high to low or vice versa. This works since the charge time for a capacitor in an RC circuit is dependent on the resistance, and the higher the resistance the longer it will take for the capacitor to charge.

We developed a sensing hat for the Pi that attaches directly to the GPIO pins. This was done to keep the implementation light weight and reduce the risk of wires coming loose over time.

## Procedure
### Software
- Install python3
- Install paho-mqtt
'''
pip install paho-mqtt
